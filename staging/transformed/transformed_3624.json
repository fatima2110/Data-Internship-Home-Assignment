    "title": "AI/ML - Machine Learning Engineer, Siri",
    "industry": "Consumer Electronics",
    "description": "Play a part in the next revolution in human-computer interaction. Contribute to a product that is redefining mobile computing. Create groundbreaking technology for large scale systems, spoken language, big data, and artificial intelligence. And work with the people who created the intelligent assistant that helps millions of people get things done - just by asking. Join the Siri Understanding team at Apple.\nThe Siri Understanding team is looking for an exceptional Machine Learning Engineer to personalize the Siri experience for millions of Apple users worldwide while preserving data privacy.\nStrong understanding of machine learning (ML) fundamentals.\nExperience in deploying ML/deep-learning solutions to real world problems.\nExperience with deep learning toolkits like Keras/TensorFlow, PyTorch etc.\nProficiency in Objective-C/C++ and Python.\nStrong analytical and data visualization skills\nExcellent problem solving, critical thinking and communication skills.\nAs a Machine Learning Engineer in the Siri Understanding team you will work on improving Siri’s Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) accuracy by training state-of-art language models (LMs) on massive text corpora. You will explore novel techniques and enhance existing algorithms for language modeling - focusing on privacy preserving ML approaches to train and adapt LMs on-device under the constraints of memory, compute and power. You will develop efficient on-device modeling pipelines for natural language processing. You will work on model optimization techniques (including but not limited to model compression, quantization etc.) to enable efficient on-device learning. You will collaborate with other research scientists and engineers in a fast-paced team environment.\nOpen to considering candidates in Seattle or Boston.\nMaster’s or PhD in Machine Learning, Computer Science or a related field.\nAcademic or industry experience in ASR or NLP.\nPreferred Qualifications:\nAny of the following qualifications is considered a plus.\nFamiliarity with n-gram and neural network algorithms and techniques used in language modeling (smoothing, pruning, interpolation, word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, transformers etc.).\nExperience in large scale distributed privacy-preserving ML and federated learning.\n2+ years of software development experience, preferably in a ML field.\nExperience in on-device modeling, in a limited resource setup.\nExperience with large scale data processing using MapReduce/Hadoop/Spark.\nExperience with training language models for ASR systems and working with standard toolkits (such as Kaldi, SRILM, OpenFST or equivalent proprietary systems)\nRole Number: 200226802",
