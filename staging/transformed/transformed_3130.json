We work hard, and we’re serious about what we do. But we like to have fun, too. We put people first, celebrate diversity, drive innovation, and do good in the communities where we live and work.\nDo you dig data? Scads and scads of data. We guess you probably do since you’re looking at a Machine Learning job ad. Payroll data … super dry stuff, huh? Well, truth is, only a subset of the population uses online shopping, or orders food deliveries, or binges TV series. But everyone, EVERYONE!, who gets paid has payroll data. More of it every month, every day, every hour. Payroll has more or less done the same thing since it was the first ever automated business application built in the 1950s. But we believe that using modern Machine Learning techniques, we can transform the way that Payroll is processed. So if you like working with huge volumes of vital data and you are interested in a goal of making people’s lives better by ensuring they get paid correctly, accurately, swiftly for the work they do, we’d love to talk to you!\nAs an ML Engineer, you will help develop data-driven, automated, comprehensive solutions using modern software and data engineering stacks to enable training, deployment, and lifecycle management of a variety of ML models – supervised and unsupervised, deep learning and classical etc. You will work closely with product managers, software engineers to deliver ML solutions that provide payroll administrators and users enormous value and efficiency. Your work will also ensure that users have the best payroll processing experience by providing predictive analytics and recommendations.\nYou will use Workday’s ML development environment and resources on rich HR and Payroll datasets to deliver value that transforms the way our customers use Payroll products. You will apply your highly technical problem solving, creative thinking, beautiful mind using the latest ML techniques and toolsets and make a huge impact on the world's largest enterprises that use Workday to process payroll for millions of employees.\nWorkday is an Equal Opportunity Employer including individuals with disabilities and protected veterans.",
