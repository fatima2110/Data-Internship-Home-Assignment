    "description": "Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We build, power, and evolve the tools and technologies that connect entrepreneurs with buyers around the world. As an Etsy employee, you’ll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.\nEtsy is hiring a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join our Ads Ranking team. This opportunity is excellent for someone who is interested in applying machine learning to tackle user-facing problems.\nThe primary goal of the team is to improve the relevance of Etsy’s on-site ads, and to price the ads fairly and efficiently. Much of this work relies on improving the accuracy of machine learning models that power our click-through-rate prediction and automatic bidding systems. We also develop new product experiences driven by machine learning systems.\nOur team works on both the development of these models, as well as the tooling we use to train, evaluate, deploy, introspect and monitor them.\nOur team is responsible for ranking and pricing ads on behalf of our sellers on Etsy’s website and mobile apps. This is an opportunity for you to play a major role in connecting our buyers with Etsy’s 90+ million listings through our ML-fueled ad platform.\nHere’s a taste of the problems we’re solving:\nYour work will span our stack, touching Python, TensorFlow, Scala, Spark and Google managed services such as BigQuery, Dataflow and AI Platform. We are proud to have an engineering culture that supports career growth and learning.\nYou can learn more one of our recent projects on our Engineering blog:\nhttps://codeascraft.com/2021/03/23/how-we-built-a-context-specific-bidding-system-for-etsy-ads/\nWe are language-agnostic in our approach to interviewing.\nThis is a full-time, position located (eventually) in our Brooklyn, NY office. We offer flexible workplace policies that can accommodate work from home candidates who are comfortable traveling to an office location 2-3 times per week.\nMany Etsy roles are open to remote candidates, and you'll be able to identify which ones within the location header of each job description. For candidates who will work remotely from Colorado, visit this link for information related to Colorado's Equal Pay for Equal Work Act.\nIf you're interested in joining the team at Etsy, please send a cover letter and resume telling us why you'd be right for the position. As you've hopefully seen already, Etsy is a place that values individuality and variety. We don't want you to be like everyone else -- we want you to be like you! So write to us and tell us what you're all about.\nAt Etsy, we believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a more relevant, more competitive, and more resilient company.
