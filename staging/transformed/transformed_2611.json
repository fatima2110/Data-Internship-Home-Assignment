    "description": "We believe the economy is better when everyone has access. When everyone has room to grow. No one should be left out because the cost is too great or the technology too complex. We started with a little white credit card reader but haven’t stopped there. We’re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.\nAs a software engineer on the Infrastructure Services team youll be building the API and management features that make obtaining and managing the computers to run software at Square a simple and straightforward process. We believe that reliable infrastructure and tooling has a tangible impact on overall productivity and profitability. Youll use your considerable skills in software development to make sure our ability to deliver robust infrastructure, from bare metal machines to cloud-based virtual machines, can be done in a highly robust and reliable manner.\nYou should feel at home working in and around Linux, and understand the subtle differences between managing bare metal and cloud based systems at large scales through software automation. Youll be working closely with Squares deployment automation and data platform teams to ensure computational resources can be managed efficiently and effectively. You love building new systems from the ground up as much as you love tweaking existing systems to meet customers' changing needs.\nAt Square, our purpose is to empower – within and outside of our walls. In order to build the best tools for the businesses and customers we support all over the world, we have to start at home with a workforce as diverse and empowered as our sellers. To this end, we take great care to evaluate all employees and job applicants equally, based on merit, competence, and qualifications. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by law. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply and always consider qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records, in accordance with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us by sending an email to assistance(at)squareup.com. We will treat your request as confidentially as possible. In your email, please include your name and preferred method of contact, and we will respond as soon as possible.",
