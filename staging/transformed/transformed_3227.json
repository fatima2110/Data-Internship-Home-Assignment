    "description": "At Stripe, a core part of our engineering culture is inclusiveness: we want to accommodate people from all backgrounds and walks of life. Stripe is for the versatile, the supportive, the impatient, and most of all, the obsessively user focused. You’ll be arriving in the first chapter of our story, and you’ll be expected to play a lead role in determining how it unfolds.\nAs a New Grad at Stripe, you’ll work on increasingly challenging projects to become an independent, high-impact software engineer. Depending upon the team, the work can focus anywhere on improving our API performance, improving the payment acceptance across the globe, or work to ensure our infrastructure is reliable enough for critical economic infrastructure.\nAs a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don’t necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it’s their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we’re building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.",
