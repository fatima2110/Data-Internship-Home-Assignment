    "description": "Embedded within the Broad Institute, the Center for the Development of Therapeutics (CDoT) is a highly collaborative organization of professional drug discovery scientists. Our mission is to translate cutting edge biological insights originating from the Broad community into impactful drug discovery projects. We partner with faculty from MIT, Harvard, and the Harvard teaching hospitals together with industry partners in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and Venture Capital firms to validate druggable targets and identify lead compounds. We combine our deep expertise in drug discovery with the knowledge and unique capabilities of the Broad Institute to address a wide range of disease areas (including oncology, cardiovascular, psychiatry, infectious and rare diseases). We use systematic approaches in genomics, biology, chemistry, and machine learning coupled with the Broad's culture of creativity, risk taking, and open sharing, to successfully advance science, develop new treatments, and positively impact patients.\nWe are currently seeking a dynamic cancer immunologist to join the CDoT Translational Pharmacology team. In this role, you will bring your knowledge of cancer immunology along with cell-based and in vivo assay development to tackle new drug discovery challenges. Working within multi-disciplinary teams of academic and industrial scientists including biochemists, structural biologists, medicinal chemists, in vivo pharmacologists and academic cancer immunology experts, you will drive the development and execution of cell-based and in vivo assays to empower the discovery and development of novel immune-oncology therapies.\nWithin the CDoT Translational Pharmacology team, you will play a key role in driving forward therapeutics projects within an exciting portfolio of novel immune-oncology targets. You will serve as a core therapeutics project team member, leading and executing development of cell-based and in vivo immune-oncology assays directly, while working with colleagues to implement these assays at scale and support screening activities to drive therapeutics programs. This role will afford the opportunity to apply your deep knowledge of cancer immunology and technical expertise in cell and molecular immunology to the development of novel therapies in collaboration with a dynamic set of academic and biopharmaceutical partners.",
