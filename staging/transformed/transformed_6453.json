and pandemic preparednessltbrgtltbrgtOpen Innovation  NITD Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases was established to address fundamental questions in drug discovery for global health This 2year Innovation Scholar position represents a unique opportunity for a PhD earlycareer Research Data Scientist to work in the San Francisco Bay Area at one of the leading research hubs focusing on solving global unmet medical needs The goal is publishable work and to make innovative models and tools available to the full global health research community Yet it benefits from the infrastructure of a worldclass pharmaceutical company with an extensive global network of scientists across a wide range of disciplines stateoftheart research facilities and with the opportunity to apply pioneering research in live fastmoving drug discovery projectsltbrgtltbrgtOf singular importance for data science research is Novartis trove of historical data acquired by literally generations of chemists and biologists It includes 10000s of assays millions of compounds and 10 millions of experimental measurements These data have been integrated through the internally developed ProfileQSAR method J Chem Inf Model 2019 5910 44504459 a massively multitask stacked model that predicts bioactivity with accuracy comparable to 4concentration doseresponse measurements for 75 of Novartis 15000 largest bioassays By contrast conventional singleassay machinelearning models achieved this success for only 8 of assays demonstrating the leverage of exploiting this extensive data resource Besides making possible superior malaria models to identify new chemical matter having the entire profile of bioactivity predictions for each compound enables identifying mechanisms of action from phenotypic screens and offtarget activities to prioritize leads with good selectivity and ADMET properties ProfileQSAR also has the unique ability for multiple research institutions to safely merge their multitask profileQSAR models exactly as if they had actually shared their compound structures targets or bioactivities J Chem Inf Model 2021 614 16031616particularly valuable in collaborative global health The Innovation Scholar will further develop the ProfileQSAR method integrate it with other methods such as generative chemistry DNA encoded libraries and structurebased design apply it in Malaria drug
