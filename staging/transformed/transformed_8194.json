    "description": "At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\nAnytime we push code, it automatically affects the millions of Internet properties (powering websites, remote teams, APIs, mobile apps, etc.) running on our global network. Cloudflare's network is one of the largest in the world and spans over 250 cities in more than 100 countries. What's more, Cloudflare operates within 50 milliseconds of 95% of the Internet-connected population globally (for context, the blink of an eye is 300-400 milliseconds!). We are passionate about making the Internet more secure, reliable, and faster for everyone.\nCloudflare’s Engineering teams build and run the software that handles the massive amount of traffic that flows through our network. We also have teams that build the UI and control plane for our software, using modern patterns and libraries in a microservices-based architecture. Technologies include: C/C++, Rust, Go, Lua, Nginx, Go, Python, Typescript, JavaScript and ReactJS.\nWe are looking for frontend, full stack and backend engineers to join our various engineering teams. We work in agile teams, so you will be supported by colleagues, and collaborate with other teams around the company.\nYou're passionate about creating great user experiences, working with designers and product managers, and developing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/Typescript - particularly React.\nYou like to write code that runs in the browser, on the server, and all the way back to a SQL database of some kind. In addition to frontend technologies, you'd enjoy writing code in Python or Go on the server.\nYou enjoy writing code that runs on the server, talks to a database, and exposes API endpoints that are either RESTful or use gRPC. You enjoy writing code in Go, C/C++, Python, or Rust.\nWe’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.\n: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\n: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\nSound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!\nThis position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations. Please note that any offer of employment may be conditioned on your authorization to receive software or technology controlled under these U.S. export laws without sponsorship for an export license.\nCloudflare is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
