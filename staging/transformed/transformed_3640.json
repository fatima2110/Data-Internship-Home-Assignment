Individuals should be friendly and easy to talk to with an overall positive attitude. We are looking for candidates with hard technical skills who are also effective communicators. Candidates should show real interest in the position and industry, meaning we want to see people who enjoy being in the weeds with data and writing efficient and maintainable code.\nIn terms of culture, we are seeking individuals who stress they want a fast-paced, team focused atmosphere, have a desire to continually learn and improve technical skills, and show desire to grow into future positions with the company. They must “want” to come to Mather Economics because data manipulation and management sounds interesting to them.\nAfter they are hired, we want to see them interact during training, engaged throughout the process, and show general aptitude in understanding the initial requirements. They should take what they learned and apply it immediately, ask questions as needed, and learn from the mistakes they make.
