    "description": "Our client continues to grow and is adding a Data Scientist to their team. The Data Scientist will independently pursue research tasks to achieve objectives defined by senior researchers and product owners. This is not an analyst position, but rather an R&D role where the scientist works with developers, operations, and quality assurance engineers to integrate novel and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms with a high-availability, scalable platform. The Data Scientist automates the path from data to decisions.   Here’s what you’ll be doing:   ·       Develop and tune statistical learning models for data analysis in fraud environments. ·       Collaborate with senior researchers and cross-functional members to understand team needs and devise possible solutions. ·       Keep up-to-date with the latest technology trends. ·       Communicate results and ideas to team members and project stakeholders. ·       Implement statistical and mathematical methodologies as defined in papers and other references. ·       Validate and verify models before and after deploying to production. ·       Adhere to appropriate data management, model governance, and version control policies.   Here’s what you bring to the team:   ·       3+ years project experience (or Masters + 2 years or Ph.D. + 0 years) in network science, graph theory, and supervised and unsupervised classification techniques: Bayesian analysis, support vector machines, neural networks, or boosted or bagged decision trees. ·       Successful research documented by publications and/or a Ph.D. or Master’s Degree in computational science, natural science, applied math, or engineering field. ·       Programming skills in Python, Scala, or Java, and machine learning packages such as Spark MLlib (preferred), Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Keras. ·       Experience with large-scale data storage and retrievals like RDBMS, NoSQL databases, or HDFS.",
