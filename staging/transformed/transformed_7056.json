platform that is comprised of many complex amp integrated systems that leverage multiple programming languages thirdparty services networks andnbspSaaSnbspstrongintegrationsstrongnbspThe SRE manager will be tasked with improving the overall observability and support of the applications and infrastructurenbspIn addition the manager will need a breadth of knowledge and an ability to pull different technology disciplines and soft skills together for the common goal nbspstrongproactively building resiliencestrongnbspinto IT infrastructure and applicationsnbspThe manager will build a team with the troubleshooting and scripting skills to improve the monitoring availability performance and security of customerfacing services and ensure they are designed for 24x7 availabilitynbspFocuses of site reliability engineering include automationnbspstrongsystem designstrong and improvements tonbspsystem resilienceppbrppstrongCore responsibilitiesstrongppbrppstrong1 People managementstrongppAlong with the normal administrative work required from a people manager SRE managers need to know how different disciplines can come together on an SRE team Oftentimes SRE teams will act somewhat independently from other engineering teams and need to work with some level of autonomy However its important that site reliability engineering managers are also wellconnected with the broader IT engineering and business teams  staying uptodate on feature development and how it could affect the systems overall reliabilityppbrppstrong2 SettingnbspstrongSLOs SLAs and SLIsppServicelevel objectives servicelevel agreements and servicelevel indicators are essential to SRE teams The site reliability engineering manager will define what it means for the system to be available and dictate the availability SLO internal metrics of the system Then the SRE manager needs to provide an SLA to business teams and the rest of engineering to show how much availability they can promise to customers Then the team can start to track SLIs to evaluate whether the system is meeting the required percentage of availabilityppbrppstrong3 Project planning and prioritizationstrongppSite reliability engineering managers are also in charge of project planning and task prioritization Its important that SRE managers sit in on quarterly planning and sprint planning with the greater engineering and IT teams Then the site reliability engineering manager can assess the key objectives for the next few sprints and pass those priorities to the rest of thenbspstrongSRE teamstrong This way the SRE team can begin building features and functions that proactively monitor the health of new features communicate observations to the rest of the team and add reliability to the overall architectureppbrppstrong4 Improving the oncall incident response processstrongppThe SRE manager will also play a role in scaling and optimizing the overallnbspstrongoncall processstrongnbspBecause incident response is such a major part of maintaining uptime and handling reliable services the SRE manager will be an important part of the crossfunctional effort to investigate and remediate issues that impact or could impact service deliverynbspThe SRE team will take ownership of setting oncall rotations alert rules communication methods andnbspstrongincident response plansstrongppbrppstrong5 Opening up communication channelsstrongppThe Site Reliability Engineering manager will have visibility into how teams across engineering and IT are working and can establish communication best practices throughout the entire software development lifecyclenbspThe SRE team will track the effectiveness of these practices and iterate when necessaryppbrppstrong6 Improving service observabilitystrongppInnbspstrongGoogles SRE eBookstrong they laid out thenbspstrongfour golden signals of SRE monitoringstrong The four golden signals include latency traffic error rate and saturation While these signals are only the start of building a highly observable system implementing the four golden signals is a great start for any SRE manager Observability is crucial for enabling site reliability engineers to identify areas for improvement prioritize future work and learn from the way their system behavesppbrppstrong7 Proactively testing the flexibility and resilience of the systemstrongppSite reliability engineering managers should proactively run tests through their applications and infrastructurenbspThis will help uncover faults and limitations that can then be addressed to further enhance system reliabilityppnbspppstrongOther responsibilitiesstrongppnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspUtilize your Coding and Automation of Applications to implement automated tests automated deployments and operational tools for a hybrid onpremcloud platformppnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspnbspCollaborate with Operations Engineering and Support teams to troubleshoot issues and implement a program of
