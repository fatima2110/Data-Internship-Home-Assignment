    "description": "Our mission is to cure cancer through high performance, accessible early cancer detection. That means saving lives.\nDelfi Diagnostics is a Johns Hopkins spinoff focused on the non-invasive detection of cancer at earlier stages, when it is most curable. DELFI uses artificial intelligence and whole genome sequencing to detect unique patterns of DNA fragmentation in the blood of patients with cancer. These analyses are performed through simultaneous examination of millions of DNA sequences using machine learning to identify tumor-specific abnormalities.\nIn our passionate pursuit to radically improve health outcomes, we serve humanity when we:\nLead with Science, Anchor in Pragmatism: We pioneer life-changing science by ensuring quality, transparency, and rigor at all times. We explore thoughtfully, experiment smartly, and deliver impact with conviction.\nBuild With & For All: We embrace diverse backgrounds to innovate and achieve together. We are not just building a product - we aim to disrupt the path of cancer for all - no matter geography or socioeconomic class\nPut We over I: We are a home for high-performing people. Through teamwork, we build collective intelligence. Each of us wins when those we serve and those who serve with us--win. We show up with empathy, humility, and integrity at every step of the journey.\nIn this role, you will work with a cross-functional team of Bioinformatics Scientists, Clinicians, Engineers, and other Data Scientists to analyze genomic and clinical data of individuals diagnosed with and at risk of cancer. This position will develop and implement machine learning to models to make predictions about a variety of clinical characteristics, including optimizing our ability to detect cancer early. Results will be communicated to internal and external stakeholders using visualizations. This work will culminate in the development of products with the potential for clinical impact.\nAn equal opportunity employer\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.",
