There is an intellectual curiosity that occurs at Drizly. We have a desire to question, to understand, to figure it out. Bottom line, we solve it. We value not just the truth but the process to get to the truth, to deliberate, decide and then act. Most importantly, we care. We care about our customer. We care about our company. We care about our team. There will be long days and incredible challenges.\nWe are blazing a trail in an industry that hasn’t changed in nearly a century, and that doesn’t scare us (well, not all the time) -and even when it does, it doesn’t stop us, it energizes us.\nDo you see yourself here?

You are comfortable collaborating with and teaching other Data Scientists on the team.\nPersonalization is a key part of our consumer facing strategy for the next 3 years. Personalization in Data Science is best built via collaboration of people and the cohesion of multiple processes into a unified user experience.
