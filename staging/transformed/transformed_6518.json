    "description": "Apple is looking for ML/Deep Learning engineers to develop and integrate machine learning technologies for autonomous systems. You will work on a hardware/software product enabled by the ML technologies you build.\nDevelop features and models to improve the capabilities of large-scale Deep Learning-based systems.\nScale up models, build training datasets and tune parameters to maximize system performance.\nBuild software that improves your rate of experimentation and helps you make better decisions about what to try next.\nWork with the team to deploy models in a mission critical environment.\nAble to train and debug deep learning systems: Defining metrics and datasets, performing error analysis, training models in a modern DL framework (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.)\nFamiliar with current DL literature and the math of machine learning: optimization methods, common types of models and layers, etc.\nStrong background in Python development with Linux. You write clean, correct code while iterating on experiments in Python. Ability to understand and contribute to C++-based software is a plus.\nExcellent communication skills. You collaborate effectively with other teams and communicate clearly about your work.\nWorking with the team you’ll join a fantastic team of hardworking engineers and researchers with deep experience in robotics, machine learning, and software engineering. We hope you’re excited about the values that drive us:\n-  Passion for the mission: We’re here to make something great. We take on whatever work is right for the product and strive for the best possible results.\n-  Modesty: The right answer is more important than being right. We search for solutions as a team and value clear-eyed feedback.\n-  Lean habits: You can’t grow without limits. Time constraints and big goals inspire us to sharpen our focus and learn to make great decisions.\nBachelors, Masters, or PhD Degree in Computer Science/Machine Learning or equivalent professional experience.\nRole Number: 200169370",
