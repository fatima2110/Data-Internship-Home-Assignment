traditional aerospace companies we sell information not hardware  we operate our sensors costeffectively at continental scale to produce novel data streams about pressing global problemsltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtFirst on our listampnbspspotting hardtomonitor emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change Since starting continuous survey operations in 2018 Kairos has removed methane emissions equal to over 92 million tonnes of CO2e through our work To put that in perspective thats equivalent to over 2 million cars being removed from the roads for a year or shutting down about seventeen 350 MW coalfired power plantsltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtWe call that a good startltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtAs a team we love science and engineering we love getting our hands dirty with hardware and software and we love seeing our work make a difference in the real worldltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtWeve created a diverse collaborative supportive and fun environment based on integrity and treating people right So no matter your gender gender identity race age beliefs sexual orientation or disabilities we welcome you and would like

ltstronggtltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtKairos hardware ranges from Linux single board computers to short wave infrared imaging cameras to GPSINS systems and are used to collect the various imagery that goes into our final data product Directly related to the hardware Kairos actively maintains the following software projects which enable that operationltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgt Python based platform for ingesting real time flight telemetry displaying data to a front end and acting as an endpoint for a user to communicate with the imaging devicesltpgtltpgt Flight software C that leverages camera

testing equipment power supply electronic load oscilloscope to run a suite of automated tests on our hardwareltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgtA software engineer operating in this role will contribute and maintain some or all of these projects Kairos is currently hitting a scale point and much of our hardwarefacing software needs to be improved in order to enable safe smooth and scalable operations to meet that demandltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgtYou will work directly at the interface between the hardware operations and software teams to listen to field feedback take in suggestions and implement the solutionltpgtltpgtYou will also work directly with the hardware itself at our office in Mountain View enabling you to reproduce field issues troubleshoot them and push fixes out into the fieldltpgtltpgtltbrgtltpgtltpgtltstronggtRequiredltstronggtltpgtltulgtltligt3 years of experienceltligtltligtThe ability to learn quickly in a selfguided manner  much of what we do is solving new

scalable software solutionsltligtltligtA desire to solve realworld problems over working on technical problems in isolation  none of our work fits in neat boxesampnbspInstead we have a team that is focused on the impact our work can have on the future of life on the planet and prioritizes realworld progress over problemfocus

provide health dental and vision insurance including subsidized coverage for dependents Our 401K plan does matching based on the amount of methane we removed from the atmosphere in a given yearltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgt We think deathmarch hours are a bad way to run a company We expect something approximating a 40hour workweek but mostly we just care that your work gets done No really Full disclosure we occasionally put in some extra hours during crunch periods but that is the exception not the normltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgt We do not track vacation time nor do we have set hours to be in the office Instead we encourage taking real vacations mental health days leaving early to pick up the kids working from home timeshifting commutes staying home when youre sick ducking out to the gym  we believe work time should be flexibleltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtIn this time of the Covid19 pandemic we have transitioned to 100 remote work aside from hardware and flight operations and plan to continue having remote positions in perpetuityltpgtltpgtampnbspltpgtltpgtWe love it when kids make a cameo in a video callltpgt",
