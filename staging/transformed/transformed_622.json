nonstandard and routine applications The work requires selection and application of standard engineering techniques procedures and criteria using judgement and ingenuity in making minor adaptations and modifications The TampE Engineer will perform work which involves conventual types of plans investigations surveys configurations or equipmentnbspppbrppThe IDEA Lab is developing a software system called the Distributed Training Network Guard DTNG This system is a controlled interface whose purpose is to bridge simulation training enclaves while segregating and protecting data on a needtoknow basis The system software includes several executables that validates and verifies the simulation training data against data format specifications and rule sets that determine if the simulation data may be passed as received passed with changes per the rule set or blocked from passing to the receiving enclave These assessments are made in both directions The data format specifications and rule sets are developed by DTNG software developers in accordance with the customers requirements and security classification
