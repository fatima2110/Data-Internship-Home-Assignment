The platform is used by thousands of designers across the globe in industries such as transportation, industrial design, media and entertainment, and apparel.\nWe’re a small team of 33. We move quickly, take pride and ownership in our work, and aim to leave a real impact on the industry. Our culture is one of innovation, collaboration, and creativity.

We’ll support you in your individual growth goals, so you’ll have access to unparalleled learning if you’re up for the challenge!\nWe work hard, and we play hard too whether we’re finding new ways for the whole team to listen to our company Spotify while remote, or playing Jackbox with colleagues there’s something for everyone from Beat Saber, to pub quizzes, to board game nights, to Zoom workouts, to collaborative fun sketching sessions in GS. We’re always open to trying new things if you want to share your hobby with the team!\nThis role will involve designing and developing large scale distributed systems to support real-time multi-user interactions in an Immersive Product (yes, even more complex than an MMO), with 3D collaboration.\nAs a Backend Engineer in an immersive technology company, you will need to understand our products and have empathy with our users. You must have a passion and motivation to improve, propose, design, and develop scalable backend systems to support low latency interactions across multi-platform applications such as desktop, mobile devices, design tablets, AR, VR and so on.

Ideally you’re always willing to try, propose, redesign, and refactor alternative solutions to be more efficient, while reducing errors, and minimising human interactions for easier maintenance.",
