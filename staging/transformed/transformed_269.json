scale in the sciences SLAC is one of the worlds premier research laboratories with internationally leading capabilities in photon science accelerator physics high energy physics HEP and energy sciencesbrbrMachine learning is expected to play an important role in nearly every major project at SLAC Applications include deep learning for detector analysis online control of facilities surrogate models for highfidelity simulations and new modes of data analysis to handle data rates that can reach TBssecond Though still in its early stages in physics ML is expected to have a transformative effect on SLACs science outputbrbrThe new ML initiative was founded to push the limits of SLACs highest impact science The data engineer position will help ML researchers scale training to large data sets deploy solutions to live experiments build infrastructure to assemble data sets and enable active control of experiments and scientific facilities While the position does not require deep ML
