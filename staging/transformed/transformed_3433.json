Company size:  900+ (World Vision USA) / 35,000 worldwide (World Vision International)    02   Join professionals with purpose       At World Vision USA you’ll join people who are all-in to impact the lives of the world's most vulnerable children. Our recipe includes love of all people, fiscal responsibility, and targeting the root causes of poverty. Our purpose includes human transformation for the most vulnerable and for the donors who support them.     And the impact is real. Every day we see donors’ hearts draw closer to the heart God has for children, families, and communities affected by poverty and injustice. The work you'll do here will help make it possible that every 60 seconds a family gets water, a hungry child is fed, and a family gets the tools they need to overcome poverty.    03 The Job      We are looking for a seasoned  data scientist  with a passion for applying machine learning and building solutions that inspire our donors and provide a better life for hundreds of thousands of children in 100 countries. You will be joining a team of two other data scientists who have been given executive level support to expand machine learning for marketing and fundraising initiatives. Responsibilities include:      Helping  define our evolving vision  and tactics of machine learning for all World Vision marketing functions.   Leveraging  automated machine learning , as well as  programming , to take predictive models from ideation to feature creation, training, and implementation.   Monitoring and  managing models over time  to ensure we are continually putting our best foot forward for our faithful donors.    Serving as analytical consultants to our marketers by setting up and  reading market tests , producing actionable insights from  deep-dive analyses , and applying best practices in  information visualization .  Applying  sound statistics  that help the organization make reliable data-driven decisions.    Keeping Christ central  in our individual and corporate lives. Attending and participating in weekly devotions, chapel services, and regular prayer.   04 You Bring      Heart for service  because we are not just working with data, we are working with valuable donor dollars and impacting the livelihood of the world’s neediest children.   Team spirit  because we try to learn from each person and function as a body of Christ, not a lone ranger or unicorn. Yet you also bring a “figure it out” attitude because you are an independent and resourceful adult.   Passion for continual learning  because our industry, our organization, and the data science world will never stop changing.  Creative problem solving  with machine learning and the fortitude to follow through to the end because our data and our projects won’t be easy.   Real-world experience in marketing data science  (including digital marketing). This means you can build models, but have also wrestled with defining training sets, creating features, and monitoring models over time because you know the building part is only the tip of the iceberg.   Fluency in SQL and Python  to pull and transform data, conduct descriptive analysis, and perform machine learning. There will be a lot of coding for sure and it won’t always be the glamorous machine learning type.  Familiarity with automated machine learning  because we’re a non-profit trying to do more with less by embracing Datarobot to do the work of 5x more people than we actually have.   Excellent verbal and written communication skills  that resonate with lay people because you’ll be working with marketers who put tremendous value in words and images.   05 Where this job could take your career    World Vision USA is a part of the larger World Vision International partnership.
