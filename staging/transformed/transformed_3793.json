years since its inception Moderna has transformed from a science researchstage company advancing programs in the promisingbutstillunproven field of messenger RNA mRNA to an enterprise with its first medicine having treated millions of people a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across six modalities a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mRNA and lipid nanoparticle formulation and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for both clinical and commercial production at scale and at unprecedented speed Moderna maintains alliances with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of manufacturing Most recently Modernas capabilities have come together to allow the authorized use of one of the earliest and mosteffective vaccines against the COVID19 pandemicbrbrModernas mRNA platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science delivery technology and manufacturing and has allowed the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases Today 24 development programs are underway across these therapeutic areas with 13 programs having entered the clinic Moderna has been named a top biopharmaceutical
