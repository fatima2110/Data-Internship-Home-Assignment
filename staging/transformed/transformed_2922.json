    "description": "The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising.\nHandling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.\nThe Trade Desk is leading the way to the future of marketing by changing how advertising is bought and sold. Working with the largest brands and agencies around the world, our technology platform helps consumers discover products they want by enabling advertisers to target and reach them on the right channels at the right time.\nEmployees join The Trade Desk to discover opportunity, contribute to our customers’ success, and be part of building the future of marketing. You’ll work with creative, compassionate, and collaborative colleagues that share a passion for making the internet better for all – a combination that simply can't be beat.\nThe Trade Desk is a rapidly growing company, as our CEO often says: \"we're only 2% done\". We are facing the biggest paradigm shift in advertising in the last century as the industry moves towards data-driven, results-oriented advertising.\nThe only way for our company to meet the massive opportunity ahead is if we are operating at peak efficiency and our employees are equipped with the best tools and technology available.\nThat's our team's responsibility and our customers are the business units within The Trade Desk (Sales, Marketing, Legal, Finance, Product, Engineering, etc.).\nWe are looking for a Product Manager to help us identify and deploy the best enterprise systems to help our teams operate at peak efficiency. Some of the systems you’ll be working with are CRM, CLM, HRIS, ERP, and EPM. We also have a host of other systems that our employees leverage to do their jobs.\nWhile these systems are often powerful, they are not always easy or delightful for end users. We are looking for someone that can bridge the gap of understanding how to leverage these powerful systems, while also having strong customer empathy. You are comfortable conversing about strategy with business unit leadership, while also digging into implementation details with your Solution Architects.\nYou can imagine the future, understand where we need to go, and articulate it to the rest of your team. While your execution focus is on the work in front of you, your planning focus is on the months, quarters, and years ahead to make sure we’re steering the ship in a good direction.\nYou can pick out what's important from the noise. In a sea of opportunity, you zero in on what should be a priority and drive towards the work that will deliver the best results.\nYou hold yourself to a high standard of excellence and care deeply about the work you deliver. You're willing to champion your ideas, even in the face of adversity.\nWe want self-aware people who can engage in a healthy exchange of ideas but understand that people always come first. We want someone we can celebrate our successes with, lament our losses, and that pushes us to always keep an unrelenting focus on our customers.\nYou've got a nose for what a good product is versus a mediocre or bad one. You have opinions about how products should look, behave, and feel, and can articulate where something isn't meeting your quality bar and why.\nWe are only as good as the impact we make. You think about the value you're delivering, rather than just the work you're doing. You know that shipping is crucial, and your customers have a right to expect the best from you. You have a track record of successfully delivering products and technical solutions with strong outcomes for your customers.\nBeing data-driven is at the core of our company's DNA. Digging deep into data and numbers is a comfortable place for you, and you've demonstrated an understanding of what insights will have the largest impact to an organization.\nYou're not the one building things, but you absolutely have to understand how they work. You're comfortable ramping up on new technology and can have meaningful discussions about implementation trade-offs with developers.\nNice-to-haves\nIn accordance with Colorado law, the range provided is The Trade Desk’s reasonable estimate of the base compensation for this role. The actual amount may be higher or lower, based on non-discriminatory factors such as experience, knowledge, skills and abilities. The Trade Desk also offers a competitive benefits package.
