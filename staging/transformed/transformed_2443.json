    "description": "Harvest is an industry-leading, independent software company that makes tools to help businesses run more smoothly. We believe that businesses only succeed by using their time intentionally. Our products support our customers through time tracking, reporting, and forecasting features.\nHarvest started in 2006 as a team of three and has grown to today’s current team of over 60 with Harvesters working from around the globe. We’ve worked as a remote team since the beginning and we continue to hire the right people for the job no matter where they call home.\nWe strive to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, included, and heard. One important aspect of this is continuing to create spaces for diverse life experiences and work histories.

We have wide-ranging responsibilities and strive to self-select which projects we work on based on our individual interests. Our team of five (at present) is collaborative, curious, loves designing resilient infrastructure, and perhaps best of all - we are empowered to have fun in the process!\nIt’s an exciting time on the infrastructure front at Harvest, and we are thrilled to be expanding our team by *two* site reliability engineers! We are designing new production systems in various cloud services, and folks with experience in designing resilient cloud infrastructure will have a lot of fun at this particular stage we are at.\nThe SRE Team has a weekly on-call rotation, and we are mindful of the overhead of being on-call. The week following your on-call shift you are free to take a day off of work to make up for the overhead of being on-call. That is a theme on our team Protecting your free time.\nBased on our team’s current geographical distribution, we are particularly interested in candidates in the US Pacific, and US Mountain Time Zones for this role, but we welcome applicants from anywhere in the world. More than half of the current SRE team is based in Europe.\nAt Harvest, our compensation consists of three main components",
