Our legacy inspires us as we forge ahead dedicated to helping our customers make their mark on the world.\nLearning does not only happen through training.

In addition to working alongside talented colleagues, you will have many opportunities to learn through coaching and stretch assignment opportunities. You’ll be guided by feedback and support to accelerate your learning and maximize your knowledge. We also have a “reverse mentoring” program which allows us to share our knowledge and strengths across our multi-generation workforce.\nInfoSight is HPE’s powerful big data analytics based monitoring and predictive analytics solution. It collects about 70 million pieces of information from each Nimble Storage array as well as from vSphere deployments, every day. It analyzes such data across the entire install base to show the customer (and resellers) deep insights in very simple and intuitive visuals. It is been recognized by customers and the analyst community as one of the core differentiators for HPE Nimble Storage. InfoSight collects and analyzes sensor data from all HPE products and Predictive Analytics are then used to correlate vast amounts of information to find the needle in the haystack and solve the customers’ most complex infrastructure issues. As impressive as they are, InfoSight’s current capabilities are only the beginning – the possibilities for analytics-based monitoring and management are endless and so is the infrastructure that keeps this running like a well-oiled machine.\nThat’s where you come in.
