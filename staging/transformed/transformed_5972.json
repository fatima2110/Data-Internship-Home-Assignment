    "description": "Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla We rely on data  lots of it  to improve autopilot to optimize hardware designs to proactively detect faults and to optimize load on the electrical grid We collect data from each of our cars superchargers and energy products and use it to make these products better and our customers saferbrbrWere the Fleet Analytics team a small but fastgrowing central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can selfserve those analyses in the future To do so we leverage the internal big data platform that is built on top of Kafka Spark Presto and data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks Pandas Bokeh Superset and AirflowbrbrWere looking for an experienced engineer to join us This foundational member will provide leadership in the definition and implementation of processes and tools that enable Teslas data sciencebrbrYou will lead our Prognostics application where we build machine learning pipelines to help identify which cars may need service so we can address issues before they inconvenience our customers Building this application is crucial to improve our customer experience as well as to optimize service operations and logistics You will own the application endtoend from prioritizing which issues to focus on to building the features and predictive models to bringing those models to production and writing the code that acts on your predictions You will directly further our mission by reducing the cost associated with cars breaking down and strengthening our brand with a customer experience that few companies can achievebrbrstronguResponsibilitiesustrongulliWork with our service organization to prioritize highvalue issuesliliDesign and build your machine learning pipeline end to endliulliWork with service engineers and firmware engineers to understand what features could help predict issuesliliBuild efficient and reproducible data pipelines to produce your features consuming petabytes of time series data using cuttingedge open source technologiesliliBuild machine learning models to predict failures and anything you need to iterate over your model feature selection hyper parameter tuning validation etcliliEvaluate justify and communicate model performanceliliSchedule and operate your model in a production data pipelineliulliBuild user interfaces to bring humans in the loop when necessary to further increase the quality of your predictionsliliWrite clean and tested code that can be maintained and extended by other software engineersliliKeep up to date on relevant technologies and frameworks and propose new ones that the team could leverageliliIdentify trends invent new ways of looking at data and get creative in order to drive improvements in both existing and future productsliliGive talks contribute to open source projects and advance data science on a global scalebrliulstronguRequirementsbrustrongulliStrong proficiency in PythonliliStrong foundation in machine learningliliStrong foundation in software engineeringliliExperience building multiple machine learning models that provided company valueliliExperience with data science tools such as Pandas Numpy R Matlab OctaveliliStrong verbal and written communication skillsliliSmart but humble with a bias for actionbrliulNice to havebrulliExperience building scheduling and operating data pipelines eg using AirflowliliExperience building web applicationsliliExperience building data visualizationsliliExperience with continuous integration and continuous developmentliliExperience in devops ie Linux Ansible Docker KubernetesliliUnderstanding of distributed computing ie how HDFS Spark Presto or Kafka workliliProficient in Scalaliul",
