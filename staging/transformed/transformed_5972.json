    "description": "Data is deeply embedded in the product and engineering culture at Tesla. We rely on data – lots of it – to improve autopilot, to optimize hardware designs, to proactively detect faults, and to optimize load on the electrical grid. We collect data from each of our cars, superchargers, and energy products and use it to make these products better and our customers safer.\nWe're the Fleet Analytics team, a small but fast-growing central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect. We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can self-serve those analyses in the future. To do so, we leverage the internal big data platform that is built on top of Kafka, Spark, Presto and data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Bokeh, Superset and Airflow.\nWe're looking for an experienced engineer to join us. This foundational member will provide leadership in the definition and implementation of processes and tools that enable Tesla's data science.\nYou will lead our Prognostics application, where we build machine learning pipelines to help identify which cars may need service so we can address issues before they inconvenience our customers. Building this application is crucial to improve our customer experience as well as to optimize service operations and logistics. You will own the application end-to-end, from prioritizing which issues to focus on, to building the features and predictive models, to bringing those models to production and writing the code that acts on your predictions. You will directly further our mission by reducing the cost associated with cars breaking down, and strengthening our brand with a customer experience that few companies can achieve.\nNice to have",
