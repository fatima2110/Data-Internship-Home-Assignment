    "description": "The CompanyltbrgtltbrgtMiso Robotics is transforming the restaurant industry and making a real impact on the worldltbrgtltbrgtMiso Robotics is writing an epic new story for the restaurant industry Weve developed a robotic kitchen assistant Flippy that can perform a variety of kitchen tasks including flipping burgers and running the deep fryer Our product is a robotic arm on a rail that fits into existing kitchens along existing cook lines and is designed to work with existing equipment alongside kitchen workers Under the hood Flippy relies on our platform which combines deep learning and other computer vision technologies with optimizationbased scheduling and nonlinear control to adapt quickly to a variety of kitchen workflows while achieving graceful and efficient motionltbrgtltbrgtThe challenge of bringing robotics into commercial kitchens requires many disciplines to come together The compositions of teams at Miso Robotics reflect this multidisciplinary nature of our work We have built a worldclass team and we are looking for more exceptional people to join us If you believe like we do that the future of the kitchen involves robotics and artificial intelligence HINT It definitely does and if you want to count yourself among the handful of lucky people whove found themselves with the opportunity to solve this problem then Miso Robotics might be the right place for youltbrgtltbrgtThe RoleltbrgtltbrgtAs a Senior Software Engineer you will be responsible for designing and developing our kitchen automation framework and cloudconnected infrastructure which power Flippy You will perform hardcore coding debugging testing and troubleshooting throughout the development process You will use your expertise in software engineering to own the design prototype and commercialization of core software focused primarily on improving the experience for the users of our systems You will work closely with robotics specialists in design controls machine learning and computer vision to continuously evolve our architecture to support an everincreasing diversity of kitchen environments and tasks allowing Flippy to operate broadly throughout the restaurant industry You will also work to make our internal framework easier and easier to use requiring less and less training to useltbrgtltbrgtWhat Youll
