    "description": "PlayStation isn’t just the Best Place to Play —it’s also the Best Place to Work. We’ve thrilled gamers since 1994, when we launched the original PlayStation. Today, we’re recognized as a global leader in interactive and digital entertainment. The PlayStation brand falls under Sony Interactive Entertainment, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Corporation.\nDo you have a passion for quality software? Do you want to work at a company where customers have real excitement for the products you help create? Are you the sort of person that is comfortable analyzing a network protocol in Wireshark one moment, debugging a ReactNative application the next? At PlayStation, we are looking for engineers to join a global initiative in robust test automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment systems.\nWe are passionate about both teamwork and technology. We love building the systems that millions of people use and are our own first customers! We strive to be at the forefront of development technologies and are a diverse company with developers on four continents.\nWe are located in San Francisco's vibrant SOMA district, within walking distance to great restaurants, museums and nightlife. While the position isn't 100% remote, the majority of work can be done from either home or office as desired.\nAs an engineer on the test tools development team, you will work as part of a team building tools that help engineers test applications delivered on PlayStation Hardware, including the PS4 and PS5. We deliver a variety of different products to the internal organization, which run the gamut from command line tools, pytest plugins to web services. Team members maintain existing tools and propose and develop new tools as needed. Our tools use many different technologies, mostly python based, but include some node based services, and other miscellaneous frameworks.\nSony is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
